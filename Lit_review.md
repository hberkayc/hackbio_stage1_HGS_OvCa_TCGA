Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide; it is estimated that there were 21,880 new cases and 13,850 deaths in 2010 alone in the United States (Jemal et al., 2009). Because of the absence of effective treatment strategies, TCGA researched to uncover the molecular abnormalities pivotal in HGS-OvCa to further pinpoint possible therapeutic targets. 

TP53 mutations were found in nearly all HGS-OvCa and, therefore, represent the most common mutation.There were nine other genes harboring low-prevalence but recurrent somatic mutations: NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, RB1, and CDK12.

Researchers compared their analysis with the publicly available dataset (Verhaak et al., 2010), these two datasets of four clusters showed a clear correlation and thus concluded that at least four robust expression subtypes (immunoreactive, differentiated, proliferative and mesenchymal) exist in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa).

When compared with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), genomic disarray is much more common (McLendon et al., 2008), and this is thought to be due to 

- high frequency of mutations,
- promoter methylation in putative DNA repair genes, especially homologous recombination components. 

The promoter region of the BRCA1 gene was hypermethylated and silenced in 11.5% of tumors (Esteller et al., 2000).

Interestingly, analysis of BRCA1/2 status showed better overall survival for BRCA1/2 mutated cases than BRCA1/2 wild-type cases. This suggests that patient survival depends on the mechanism of BRCA1 inactivation. Also, according to published research, cells with methylation or mutant BRCA1 or BRCA2 have defective homologous recombination and are highly responsive to PARP inhibitors (Farmer et al., 2005; Fong et al., 2009). In conclusion, around 50% of HGS-OvCa tumors with homologous recombination defects could be treated with PARP inhibitors.

Furthermore, therapeutic treatment options are presented by the typically disrupted pathways, RB, RAS/PI3K, FOXM1, and NOTCH.

HGS-OvCa has a completely distinct mutation spectrum from other ovarian cancer types. For example, other ovarian cancer tumors have frequent CTNNB1, ARID1A, and PIK3CA mutations and a lower rate of TP53 (Kuo et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2010). These differences may seem like a disadvantage; however, this occasion makes up an opportunity to improve personalized treatment. 

Lastly, in HGS-OvCa cases where the target genes are amplified, investigation is required as inhibitors already exist for 22 genes in regions of recurrent amplification.

In conclusion, in order to discovery novel therapeutic approaches and advance the personalized treatment, transcriptomic/epigenomic profiling of the patients, and ultimately tumor types, is crucial.
